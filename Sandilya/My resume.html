                Here</a>
    
            <br><b> Approach: </b> Detecting reviews which are camouflaged as truthful ones is very challenging with
            conventional
            classification models. In this relatively new approach, using features built on review text and metadata, a
            tri partite graph is built over which MRF techniques are applied to check the authenticity of reviews . <br>
